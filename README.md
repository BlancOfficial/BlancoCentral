# BlancoCentral

_To run this discord bot backend, ensure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) is downloaded_

---

## Runtime

 Run the `run.bat` file, alternatively open terminal within the `BlancoBot` folder and enter `node .`

Remember to add your bot credentials to `auth.json`.

## Basis

BlancoCentral is a culmination of months dedicated to bashing my head againt dicord js while ignoring the documentation.
It's a 3 part project but due to Discord API v10 both BruhBot and RepeatoBot will have to be layed to rest, leaving BlancoBot as the final survivor.

---

## Plan

Updating from Discord JS v13 to v14, in order to support Discord API v10, BlancoBot requires extensive work to ensure that all message based commands are switched for slash commands

I have made decent headway into the process in which I'd have to do this, however there is much still to do. ðŸ˜­

This would also go a long way in making the code look more legible.
