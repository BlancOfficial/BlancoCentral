# BlancoCentral

_To run this discord bot backend, ensure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) is downloaded_

---

## Runtime

Run the `run.bat` file, alternatively open terminal within the `BlancoBot` folder and enter `node deploy-commands.js`, then `node .`

Remember to add your bot credentials to `auth.json`.

## Basis

BlancoCentral is a culmination of months dedicated to bashing my head againt dicord js while ignoring the documentation.
It was a 3 part project but due to Discord API v10 both BruhBot and RepeatoBot were both laid to rest, leaving BlancoBot as the final survivor.

---

## Plan

To add ping mentions on action commands.
To slash profile commands
